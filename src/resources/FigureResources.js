In fact, you don’t need to worry about packing any of the usual cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay.  We provide a baby bath, bath toys, pool toys, a potty, and baby chair.  Just let us know what you need and anything we don’t have in-house can be easily hired at minimal additional cost, such as pool gates.  For older children there are swimming pool toys, flippers, and a croquet set. With three rooms in the main house, all on one level, wide doors to the bedrooms, and just a few steps down to the living pavilion, access and inclusion in all activities is easy for all ages at Villa Frangipani.'

Other activities that may be of interest include -  white water rafting, and treks to stunning waterfalls, and rice terraces, or snorkeling trips.'
